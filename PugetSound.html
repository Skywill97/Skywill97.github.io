        Discovery Park is Seattle's largest park with over 8 miles of hiking trails, all of which are open to dogs. The only area of the park closed to four legged friends is the beach.

      <h3>Loop Trail</h3>
      <p>
        The loop trail is a 2.8 mile trail with rolling hills and 140 feet of elevation change. It's perfect for small and large dogs, and has beautiful views of Puget Sound and the Olympic mountains on a clear day.
      </p>
      <h3>Beach Trails</h3>
      <p>
        The South and North Beach Trails take hikers from the Loop Trail down to the beach and lighthouse. Each trail is about a mile long, with 400 feet of elevation gain. There is a one mile trail that runs along the beach and past the lighthouse, connecting the bottom of the North and South Beach Trails. Add these trails to the loop trail for a 5 mile hike.
